Is the game too easy or hard? Give 3 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.

I think that the game is too easy. The first reason that I think this is because you move very quickly so it's easy to grab and avoid power-ups. The second reason that I think that the game is too easy is because the power-ups move way too slowly. The last reason that I think that the game is too easy is because there are a few different obstacles in your way.

What 3 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

The three changes that I would make to make the game harder would be to add a jump mechanic. I would then create an obstacle that you can only avoid by jumping. the last way that I would make it harder would be to speed up obstacles. 

List three things that would give it a "wow" factor.

I think that giving the prefab audio would make the game more engaging. I also think that giving the power-ups and obstacles different textures could wow some. Lastly, I think that a death animation would feel fitting due to the nature of the game.

The parts of the game that are tedious would have to be running in a straight line. I also think that the variation between spawns can be pretty boring. Lastly, I think that the time is too short, and feels repetitive every time you restart.
