I think that the game is just right. The balls move fast enough where it is a challenge to hit but not too hard.

I think that we could make the balls a little slower just to have a sense of contol comapred to the very random paths they take.

I think that sounds and textures can give the game a wow factor.

I think that the hitting of the balls are satifying but lining up the shot is tedious.
